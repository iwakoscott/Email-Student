# Email-Student
I created this code during the Spring of 2016 when I was working as a reader for Applied Linear Algebra (MAT167 at UC Davis.) When the UC Davis' learning management system went down for the last 3 weeks of the quarter, I had trouble returning the graded electronic submissions to each student. This was a task that was relatively simple using UC Davis' learning management system---Smartsite. I decided to take it upon myself to help my professor by writing a Python program to email back each individual their graded assignments back.
